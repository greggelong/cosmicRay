cosmic ray detector using CMOS in phone and computer webcams

using p5js and processing to read the camera pixels

a variety of visualizations are possible

and trigger for kinetic sculpture

really need some radioactive material to text a baseline

will try to run it through the xray machine

originally saw a few videos of youtube using this

https://youtu.be/06qlhZqn-KY?si=urwp4dkLzZclbiFj

they used software

Theremino ParticleDetector V1.0

I thought it would be cool to use processing and p5js to get data from the CMOS

and use it as a tool for art projects
